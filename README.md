# Lizitt Outfitter (Unity3D)

## Notice

**This project is in flux** as its undergoes a major redesign.  Components are checked-in as individual unit testing is completed. Changes will be frequent and proper integration testing is limited during this phase. Release v0.2.0 will be created once the design has stabilized and all testing completed.

## Overview

API Status: Pre-release Alpha  
Test Status: Beta  
Language: C#  
Target: [Unity3D](http://unity3d.com/unity) 5.3+ (Personal & Professional)

The Outfitter helps a user to define prototypes (usually prefabs) that represent outfits and accessories.  These components are combined at run-time to represent an agent's body.  Certain parts of the outfits, such as materials can be overriden in order to support outfit variants.  At run-time the outfits and accessories are instantiated as needed to create a body.
