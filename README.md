# Lizitt Outfitter (Unity3D)

## Notice

**This project is in flux.**  It has undergone a major redesign.  The redesign is undergoing final testing, with components being checked-in as their testing is completed.  This message will be removed and release v0.2.0 created once the entire process is complete.

## Overview

API Status: Pre-release Alpha  
Test Status: Beta  
Language: C#  
Target: [Unity3D](http://unity3d.com/unity) 5.3+ (Personal & Professional)

The Outfitter helps a user to define prototypes (usually prefabs) that represent outfits and accessories.  These components are combined at run-time to represent an agent's body.  Certain parts of the outfits, such as materials can be overriden in order to support outfit varients.  At run-time the outfits and accessories are instantiated as needed to create a body.
